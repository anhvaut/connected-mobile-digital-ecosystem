/**
 * <p>
 * Provides the classes for the optimization problem. To define a new optimization problem, the
 * {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Creator}, the {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Decoder}, and the
 * {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Evaluator} must be defined.
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Creator}</dt>
 * <dd>
 * The task of the {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Creator} is the creation of random {@link org.opt4j.core.Genotype}s. It
 * is typically used at the beginning of an optimization by the {@link org.opt4j.core.optimizer.Optimizer} to create the
 * initial {@link org.opt4j.core.optimizer.Population}. The size of the {@link org.opt4j.core.Genotype}s, the
 * {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Creator} creates, define the search space for the
 * {@link org.opt4j.core.optimizer.Optimizer}. The package {@link org.opt4j.genotype} contains predefined
 * {@link org.opt4j.core.Genotype} classes that allow a modular assembly. Thus, usually you do not have to write your
 * custom {@link org.opt4j.core.Genotype}.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Decoder}</dt>
 * <dd>The task of the {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Decoder} is the decoding from a given
 * {@link org.opt4j.core.Genotype} to a corresponding {@link org.opt4j.core.Phenotype}. The
 * {@link org.opt4j.core.Phenotype} is the object you expect as a solution of the optimization. If you cannot modify
 * this object to implement {@link org.opt4j.core.Phenotype}, the {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.PhenotypeWrapper} can be
 * used.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Evaluator}</dt>
 * <dd>The task of the {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Evaluator} is the evaluation of {@link org.opt4j.core.Phenotype}s
 * to the {@link org.opt4j.core.Objectives}. This is typically used by the {@link org.opt4j.core.optimizer.Optimizer} to
 * determine the fitness of the {@link org.opt4j.core.Individual} or by the {@link org.opt4j.core.optimizer.Archive} to
 * determine if the {@link org.opt4j.core.Individual} Pareto-dominates another one.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * Additional information about the problem should be contained in an user defined class that is injected as needed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Inherit from the {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.ProblemModule} to bind a {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Creator},
 * {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Decoder}, and {@link org.opt4j.core.problem.Evaluator} belonging together.
